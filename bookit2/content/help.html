<h1>Bookit v0.5.6</h1>
<p>
Starting with the next release I'll be putting help information here.
</p>
<p>
If you're upgrading from a very old version of Bookit many things have changed, please check the preferences pane and verify the paths to the calibre utilities.
</p>
<p>
I've included basic support for the 0.6 calibre betas.  Be sure to check the 
'use ebook-convert' when using a 0.6 beta release.  When 0.6 becomes the 
primary release I'll be dropping support for the older utilities and focus on 
supporting ebook-convert.
